Set-up to make Google+ sign-in work while debugging :
===================

Simply copy the key to your machine, in the folder "~/.android/debug.keystore" on linux typically, or "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" for Windows.

The key can be found at the root of our repo, and is named "debug.keystore".

Under Linux :
$ cd <app root folder>
$ cp debug.keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
